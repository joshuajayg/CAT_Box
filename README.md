# CAT_Box
RS-232 CAT control for your Kenwood (or other) radio.  Sends macros at the push of a button.

This is a very simple RS-232 serial interface between and Arduino Nano and a radio (I have used it with the Ts-890S.)  You hardcode the CAT commands (macros) into the Nano, hit a button, and the nano sends the CAT commands to the radio through a serial level converter.  

Thank you to Chris at ignorantofthings.com for the code for the resistor ladder, explanations on his website, and calculator spreadsheet.
